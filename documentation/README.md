# How to Document LMS Hackathon

The documentation should focus on how to use and understand the Library Management System (LMS) that you're developing, while the tutorial should guide users through the process of creating a similar web app using Frappe, showing them step-by-step how to replicate your project.

This table outlines the key differences between documentation (which focuses on the finished product) and the tutorial (which guides users on how to create that product).

# Use Of Documentation.md
We need to improve upon this by dividing this documentation into 10 pages(10 topics in table).
In the first page give h1 as Overview/Introduction(completely tentative).
And so on for every row of the above table.
