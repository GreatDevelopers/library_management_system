# Usage Instructions for the Library Management System (LMS)

This section explains the overall concept of the Library Management System (LMS) and outlines the app's current functionalities and future potential. It highlights the roles of librarians and library members, detailing what the app achieves in its current form and what features will be added in the future. 

*The next lesson will go into detail on how a librarian can efficiently use the desk and perform their various tasks within the system.*

## Concept Overview

The Library Management System (LMS) is designed with two primary user roles in mind:

- **Librarian**: The librarian has full access to the system, allowing them to manage the entire library digitally. This includes adding books, issuing them through transactions, and creating library members. Essentially, the librarian is the central figure in the LMS, responsible for maintaining the digital structure of the library.

- **Library Member**: A library member has a more limited role, with the primary ability being to view the books available in the library. The system is currently designed to focus more on backend processes, making it easy for librarians to manage the library.

As of now, the app is more backend-focused, giving the librarian all the access and an easy-to-manage digital setup of the library.

> **Future Enhancements (Coming Soon):**
> - [ ] Ability for library members to issue a book by filling out a form.
> - [ ] Ability for the librarian to keep records of where books are physically located in the library, making it visible to members who fill the form to issue it.
> - [ ] Automatic fine calculation for late returns.
> - [ ] Ability for non-library members to fill out a request form to become a library member.
