Hi! I am Mantej Singh Josan, I love collaborating and working together.

I am set on my web devleopment journey since 2023, having learnt html, css, js basics I am now learning React.js
I have some experience with other Javascript libraries like mathjax, mermaid, locomotive, and GSAP.

In my school time i learnt Java (OOP+basic GUI). 

I learnt a lot about Linux and opensource after I joinegot admission in GNDEC, Ludhiana in B.Tech CSE in July 2024.
I also got to know about a lot of stuff, from our professor and mentor MR. H.S. Rai, which I am yet to solidify in my mind.
